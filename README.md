## 🚀 Portfolio: Selected Works & Achievements

Beyond my current focus on developer tooling, my work has spanned cloud infrastructure, FinTech, backend-heavy, and full-stack application development. This is a showcase of problems I've solved and projects I've built that demonstrate scalable design and practical engineering trade-offs.

### Professional Highlights & Impact Metrics

* **FinTech Performance Engineering (Lightway Finance):** Led the re-architecture of a cross-border payout system by integrating banking APIs and a pooled wallet system. **Result: Reduced average processing latency and improved throughput.**
* **Cloud-Native Architecture (Gr33nwh33lz):** Architected and deployed a scalable microservices backend for an EV tracking platform on AWS, using Docker, EC2, and NGINX. The system processes real-time telemetry at scale.
* **Web Performance Optimization (Money Prep):** Drove a migration to Next.js and Vercel's global CDN, overhauling the frontend architecture. **Result: A 77% reduction in Speed Index (10.4s to 2.4s).**
* **BI & Analytics Tooling (Sterling Currency Exchange):** Developed a real-time BI tool for reporting and transaction analysis. **Result: Contributed to a 10% growth in revenue and reduced SLA recovery time.**

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Peculiar ORM**       | A lightweight TypeScript ORM for PostgreSQL offering graceful pg reconnection, query timeouts, deep observability, explicit transactions, clean repository & mapping patterns, predictable migrations, and native Inversify DI... all with zero unnecessary abstraction. |
| **Node_be_v2**         | A production-ready Node.js backend starter template engineered around clean architecture and scalability. Ships with opinionated project structure, dependency injection, and production-focused defaults. |
| **be_v1**              | A high-performance replica of node_be_v2 written on Bun and Hono. Designed for low-latency backends with a small memory footprint and faster cold-starts. Uses decorator-based routing built on top of the companion package **hono-injector**. |
| **hono-injector**      | A Decorator-based routing and dependency injection library for Hono, heavily inspired by inversify-express-utils. Enables controller decorators, injectable services, and clean DI patterns for Hono apps. |
| **Agentic Accountant** | (Concept) A personal finance tool that acts as an AI agent, providing autonomous insights and predictive budget reports.                                                 |
| **GiftFlex**           | A full-stack gift wishlisting and fulfillment marketplace designed so people can show and receive love more thoughtfully.                                                |
| **Sprauwt**            | Personal tool used to manage budgets across multiple financial profiles and portfolios.                                                                                  |
