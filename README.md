## üèÜ Featured Project: Arch-Code

**I believe the best engineers build tools that create leverage for others. Arch-Code is my answer to a core frustration in our industry: system diagramming is slow, manual, and disconnected from our code.**

Arch-Code is a high-velocity, open-source tool that treats system architecture as what it should be: **code**.

By defining architecture with a simple, declarative syntax, Arch-Code enables engineers to version, collaborate on, and automate system diagrams, integrating them directly into the modern development lifecycle.

### Key Technical Features
* **‚úçÔ∏è Intuitive, Declarative DSL:** A clean, YAML-based syntax designed for readability and speed.
* **‚ö° Real-Time Rendering Engine:** A performant engine built with **TypeScript** and **SvelteKit** that instantly renders diagrams as you type.
* **üîÑ Git-Native Collaboration:** Enables architectural reviews within pull requests, treating diagrams just like any other piece of code.
* **üß© Extensible Component Library:** Ships with icons for AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes.

## üöÄ Portfolio: Selected Works & Achievements

Beyond my current focus on developer tooling, my work has spanned cloud infrastructure, FinTech, backend heavy, and full-stack application development. This is a showcase of problems I've solved and value I've delivered.

### Professional Highlights & Impact Metrics

* **FinTech Performance Engineering (Lightway Finance):** Led the re-architecture of a cross-border payout system by integrating banking APIs and a pooled wallet system. **Result: Reduced average payout times by 85% and increased user retention by 33%.**
* **Cloud-Native Architecture (Gr33nwh33lz):** Architected and deployed a scalable microservices backend for an EV tracking platform on AWS, using Docker, EC2, and NginX. The system processes real-time geospatial data and handles secure KYC verification with AWS Rekognition.
* **Web Performance Optimization (Money Prep):** Drove a migration to Next.js and Vercel's global CDN, overhauling the frontend architecture. **Result: A 77% reduction in Speed Index (10.4s to 2.4s) and a 98% decrease in Total Blocking Time.**
* **BI & Analytics Tooling (Sterling Currency Exchange):** Developed a real-time BI tool for reporting and transaction analysis. **Result: Contributed to a 10% growth in revenue and reduced SLA response times by 30%.**
